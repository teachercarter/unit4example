            <p>Here are some rules of Ulitmate. The game has no referees, so the players must know the rules, and hold themselves to following them. #accountability.</p>
            <ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Most important rule - "Spirit of the Game". Be nice to other players and follow the rules!</li><li>You can't run with the frisbee. To get it to other people, you have to throw it.</li><li>To score a point, you have to catch the frisbee in your team's endzone</li><li>It's a non-contact sport, so if you hit someone it's a foul.</li></ol>
